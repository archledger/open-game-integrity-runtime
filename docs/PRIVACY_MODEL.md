# Privacy model

OGIR applies data minimization at the protocol boundary.

## Allowed information classes

- publisher/game/build/match identifiers already known to the publisher;
- selected integrity policy identifier;
- accepted profile identifiers and digests;
- TPM-backed freshness and measurement evidence;
- publisher-scoped attestation identity;
- game/runtime/session manifest digests;
- structured policy outcomes;
- short-lived session public key.
- opaque session public-key lookup handle scoped to one publisher and protected session;

## Disallowed information classes

- complete system process list;
- names of unrelated applications;
- browser, chat, document, or home-directory content;
- unrelated file paths;
- raw biometric samples or templates;
- universal cross-publisher device identifier;
- raw TPM Endorsement Key as a game identifier;
- arbitrary publisher-selected host queries;
- persistent global monitoring after the game session.
- session-key or key-handle reuse as a stable cross-session/cross-publisher correlation identifier;

## Controls

- fixed claim schema;
- local maximum-disclosure policy;
- publisher-scoped Attestation Keys;
- hashed or abstracted accepted-profile results where possible;
- redacted local logging;
- short retention periods;
- user-visible policy before protected mode;
- session-scoped enforcement and cleanup;
- privacy tests that fail when forbidden fields appear.
- a fresh future key/handle for every new session or publisher, with renewal-only reuse inside one session;
- fixed `SessionPublicKeyId` Debug redaction and explicit byte access treated as a trusted functional boundary;
